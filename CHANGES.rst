0.3.0 (unreleased)
==================

- Change ConfigObj.update() to merge() when combining user-provided
  config_file and step-specific flags during a step.call() to properly
  merge dicts of step flags [#22]

- Drop the ``stspec`` command-line tool, which is no longer relevant
  now that config files are stored in ASDF format.  See ``strun --save-parameters``
  or the ``Step.export_config`` method for options for generating
  ASDF config files. [#25]

- Prevent ConfigObj from treating DataModel as a config section. [#26]

- Added Step class attribute ``name_format`` to provide Steps control over
  output filename formatting by using an input format string rather than
  the default formatting. [#29]

==================

- Workaround for setuptools_scm issues with recent versions of pip. [#27]
