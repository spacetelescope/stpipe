==================

- convert ``FromCommandLine`` instances to str before using as keyword arguments to ``Step`` [#78]

0.4.4 (2022-12-16)
==================

- include ``scripts`` in package [#76]

0.4.3 (2022-12-15)
==================

- Load and merge configuration files for each step they are provided when
  running pipeline in interactive mode using ``Step.call()``. [#74]

- Restored support for step list arguments by removing code that was
  overwriting processed and validated command line arguments with their
  raw values. [#73]


0.4.2 (2022-07-29)
==================

- Refactored ``Step.crds_get_config_from_reference`` and
  ``Pipeline.get_config_from_reference`` to reduce memory when the input to
  a pipeline is an association file, i.e. a ``ModelContainer``. In this case
  the crds parameters are retrieved from the first model which is already opened. [#63]

- Added a small edit to ``Step.get_config_from_reference`` to run datamodel
  methods on the first contained model in a ModelContainer, rather than the
  ModelContainer itself [#67]

- Moved build configuration from ``setup.cfg`` to ``pyproject.toml`` to support PEP621 [#56]

0.4.1 (2022-07-14)

- Update CI workflows to cache test environments and depend upon style and security checks [#55, #58]

- Correctly handle config merges of default spec, any possible step-pars files (from
  CRDS or the user), and either command line (for strun) or step parameter dictionary (for interactive
  session Pipeline.call()) parameter specifications [#57]

- Remove log dump of any CRDS-retrieved PARS-reference files [#60]

0.3.3 (2022-04-07)
==================

- Ensure product header is passed for CRDS fetching instead of empty
  ModelContainer header [#50]

0.3.2 (2022-03-29)
==================

- Pass header-only model to steps for CRDS fetching to reduce memory usage [#38]

- For classmethods, use the delegator logger. [#37]

==================

- Fig a bug that prevented support for list arguments. [#33]

- Add keyword 'logcfg' to Step.call() to set logging configuration. [#32]

0.3.0 (2021-10-11)
==================

- Change ConfigObj.update() to merge() when combining user-provided
  config_file and step-specific flags during a step.call() to properly
  merge dicts of step flags [#22]

- Drop the ``stspec`` command-line tool, which is no longer relevant
  now that config files are stored in ASDF format.  See ``strun --save-parameters``
  or the ``Step.export_config`` method for options for generating
  ASDF config files. [#25]

- Prevent ConfigObj from treating DataModel as a config section. [#26]

- Added Step class attribute ``name_format`` to provide Steps control over
  output filename formatting by using an input format string rather than
  the default formatting. [#29]
