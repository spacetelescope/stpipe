    This Abstract Base Class is intended to cover multiple implementations of
    data models so that each will be considered an appropriate subclass of this
    class without requiring that they inherit this class.

    Any datamodel class instance that desires to be considered an instance of
    AbstractDataModel must implement the following methods.

    In addition, although it isn't yet checked (the best approach for supporting
    this is still being considered), such instances must have a meta.filename
    attribute.
