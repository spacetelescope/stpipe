    This is a protocol to describe the methods and properties that define a
    DataModel for the purposes of stpipe. This is a runtime checkable protocol
    meaning that any object can be `isinstance` checked against this protocol
    and will succeed even if the object does not inherit from this class.
    Moreover, this object will act as an `abc.ABC` class if it is inherited from.

    Any datamodel class instance that desires to be considered an instance of
    must fully implement the protocol in order to pass the `isinstance` check.

    In addition, although it isn't yet checked (the best approach for supporting
    this is still being considered), such instances must have a meta.filename
    attribute.
